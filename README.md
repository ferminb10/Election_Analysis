# Election_Analysis
Performing analysis on Election data to uncover trends.
## Overview of Project
This weeks challenge helps us build upon our skills learned in the VBA module. The client wants to do a do research for his parents. He'd like to possibly expand the dataset to the entire stock market over the last few years.

Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of this election analysis audit is well defined. (3 pt)

## Results
The analysis had few tasks. First, a solution code was refractored to loop through all stock data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, it was determined if that our refactored code successfully performed better than the original script, the results shown below.


Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Which county had the largest number of votes?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
There is a bulleted list where each election outcome is addressed. (7 pt)

## Summary
Based on the results of this test the refractered code was a more efficient version of the original script. This is one of the benefits of refractoring code. You can take code and try to optimize. The limitations of this dataset is that it only provides a small dataset. This script doesn't do a good job of testing its limits. I was curious to know how long it would take to run the S&P 500. One of the disadvantages of refractoring code for the particular application of analyzing thousands of stocks is that the program may take a long time to execute. You can easily make this to your advantage if you're well educated in economics and have it tailored to a specific set that you want. The refractored script proved to be a much more efficient than the original based on the executed times. The faster it can be the more applicible it can be for a wider range of datasets.



In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
There is a statement to the election commission that explores how this script can be used for any election, with two examples for modifying the script. (4 pt)
